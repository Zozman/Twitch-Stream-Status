Twitch Stream Status
====================

An application that will trigger an alert if a channel on Twitch goes down for Mac OS X.

Just enter your channel's name, hit the start button, and the app will constantly check with Twitch to make sure that the channel is still up.
If it goes down, then the app will admit an extremely loud siren to alert you.  Perfect for when your streaming but don't want to have to watch your own stream.

Made using the Twitch API.
